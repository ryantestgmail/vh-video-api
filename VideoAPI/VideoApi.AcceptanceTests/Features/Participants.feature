﻿Feature: Participants
  In order to manage participants in a conference
  As an API service
  I want to create, update and retrieve participant data

  Scenario: Add participant
    Given I have a conference
    And I have an add participant to a valid conference request
    When I send the request to the endpoint
    Then the response should have the status NoContent and success status True
	And the participant is added

    Given I have a conference
    And I have an remove participant from a valid conference request
    When I send the request to the endpoint
